<h3> <a id="sceneII_30.2"></a><b>SCENE II. Capulet’s Garden.</b></h3>
<p class="scenedesc">Enter <span class="charname">Romeo</span>.</p>
<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br>
He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
</p>
<p class="scenedesc"><span class="charname">Juliet</span> appears above at a window.</p>
<p class="drama">
But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?<br>
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun!<br>
Arise fair sun and kill the envious moon,<br>
Who is already sick and pale with grief,<br>
That thou her maid art far more fair than she.<br>
Be not her maid since she is envious;<br>
Her vestal livery is but sick and green,<br>
And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.<br>
It is my lady, O it is my love!<br>
O, that she knew she were!<br>
She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that?<br>
Her eye discourses, I will answer it.<br>
I am too bold, ’tis not to me she speaks.<br>
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,<br>
Having some business, do entreat her eyes<br>
To twinkle in their spheres till they return.<br>
What if her eyes were there, they in her head?<br>
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,<br>
As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven<br>
Would through the airy region stream so bright<br>
That birds would sing and think it were not night.<br>
See how she leans her cheek upon her hand.<br>
O that I were a glove upon that hand,<br>
That I might touch that cheek.
</p>
<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br>
Ay me.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br>
She speaks.<br>
O speak again bright angel, for thou art<br>
As glorious to this night, being o’er my head,<br>
As is a winged messenger of heaven<br>
Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes<br>
Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him<br>
When he bestrides the lazy-puffing clouds<br>
And sails upon the bosom of the air.
</p>
<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br>
O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?<br>
Deny thy father and refuse thy name.<br>
Or if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,<br>
And I’ll no longer be a Capulet.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br>
[<i>Aside.</i>] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
</p>
<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br>
’Tis but thy name that is my enemy;<br>
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.<br>
What’s Montague? It is nor hand nor foot,<br>
Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part<br>
Belonging to a man. O be some other name.<br>
What’s in a name? That which we call a rose<br>
By any other name would smell as sweet;<br>
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call’d,<br>
Retain that dear perfection which he owes<br>
Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,<br>
And for thy name, which is no part of thee,<br>
Take all myself.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br>
I take thee at thy word.<br>
Call me but love, and I’ll be new baptis’d;<br>
Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
</p>
<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br>
What man art thou that, thus bescreen’d in night<br>
So stumblest on my counsel?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br>
By a name<br>
I know not how to tell thee who I am:<br>
My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,<br>
Because it is an enemy to thee.<br>
Had I it written, I would tear the word.
</p>
<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br>
My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words<br>
Of thy tongue’s utterance, yet I know the sound.<br>
Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br>
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.
</p>
<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br>
How cam’st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?<br>
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,<br>
And the place death, considering who thou art,<br>
If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br>
With love’s light wings did I o’erperch these walls,<br>
For stony limits cannot hold love out,<br>
And what love can do, that dares love attempt:<br>
Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.
</p>
<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br>
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br>
Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye<br>
Than twenty of their swords. Look thou but sweet,<br>
And I am proof against their enmity.
</p>
<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br>
I would not for the world they saw thee here.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br>
I have night’s cloak to hide me from their eyes,<br>
And but thou love me, let them find me here.<br>
My life were better ended by their hate<br>
Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
</p>
<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br>
By whose direction found’st thou out this place?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br>
By love, that first did prompt me to enquire;<br>
He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.<br>
I am no pilot; yet wert thou as far<br>
As that vast shore wash’d with the farthest sea,<br>
I should adventure for such merchandise.
</p>
<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br>
Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face,<br>
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek<br>
For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight.<br>
Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny<br>
What I have spoke; but farewell compliment.<br>
Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say Ay,<br>
And I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear’st,<br>
Thou mayst prove false. At lovers’ perjuries,<br>
They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,<br>
If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.<br>
Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,<br>
I’ll frown and be perverse, and say thee nay,<br>
So thou wilt woo. But else, not for the world.<br>
In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond;<br>
And therefore thou mayst think my ’haviour light:<br>
But trust me, gentleman, I’ll prove more true<br>
Than those that have more cunning to be strange.<br>
I should have been more strange, I must confess,<br>
But that thou overheard’st, ere I was ’ware,<br>
My true-love passion; therefore pardon me,<br>
And not impute this yielding to light love,<br>
Which the dark night hath so discovered.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br>
Lady, by yonder blessed moon I vow,<br>
That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops,—
</p>
<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br>
O swear not by the moon, th’inconstant moon,<br>
That monthly changes in her circled orb,<br>
Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br>
What shall I swear by?
</p>
<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br>
Do not swear at all.<br>
Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,<br>
Which is the god of my idolatry,<br>
And I’ll believe thee.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br>
If my heart’s dear love,—
</p>
<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br>
Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,<br>
I have no joy of this contract tonight;<br>
It is too rash, too unadvis’d, too sudden,<br>
Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be<br>
Ere one can say “It lightens.” Sweet, good night.<br>
This bud of love, by summer’s ripening breath,<br>
May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.<br>
Good night, good night. As sweet repose and rest<br>
Come to thy heart as that within my breast.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br>
O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
</p>
<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br>
What satisfaction canst thou have tonight?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br>
Th’exchange of thy love’s faithful vow for mine.
</p>
<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br>
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it;<br>
And yet I would it were to give again.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br>
Would’st thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?
</p>
<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br>
But to be frank and give it thee again.<br>
And yet I wish but for the thing I have;<br>
My bounty is as boundless as the sea,<br>
My love as deep; the more I give to thee,<br>
The more I have, for both are infinite.<br>
I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu.<br>
[<i>Nurse calls within.</i>]<br>
Anon, good Nurse!—Sweet Montague be true.<br>
Stay but a little, I will come again.
</p>
<p class="right">[<i>Exit.</i>]</p>
<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br>
O blessed, blessed night. I am afeard,<br>
Being in night, all this is but a dream,<br>
Too flattering sweet to be substantial.
</p>
<p class="scenedesc">Enter <span class="charname">Juliet</span> above.</p>
<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br>
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.<br>
If that thy bent of love be honourable,<br>
Thy purpose marriage, send me word tomorrow,<br>
By one that I’ll procure to come to thee,<br>
Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite,<br>
And all my fortunes at thy foot I’ll lay<br>
And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
</p>
<p class="drama">
NURSE.<br>
[<i>Within.</i>] Madam.
</p>
<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br>
I come, anon.— But if thou meanest not well,<br>
I do beseech thee,—
</p>
<p class="drama">
NURSE.<br>
[<i>Within.</i>] Madam.
</p>
<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br>
By and by I come—<br>
To cease thy strife and leave me to my grief.<br>
Tomorrow will I send.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br>
So thrive my soul,—
</p>
<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br>
A thousand times good night.
</p>
<p class="right">[<i>Exit.</i>]</p>
<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br>
A thousand times the worse, to want thy light.<br>
Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books,<br>
But love from love, towards school with heavy looks.
</p>
<p class="right">[<i>Retiring slowly.</i>]</p>
<p class="scenedesc">Re-enter <span class="charname">Juliet,</span> above.</p>
<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br>
Hist! Romeo, hist! O for a falconer’s voice<br>
To lure this tassel-gentle back again.<br>
Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud,<br>
Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,<br>
And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine<br>
With repetition of my Romeo’s name.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br>
It is my soul that calls upon my name.<br>
How silver-sweet sound lovers’ tongues by night,<br>
Like softest music to attending ears.
</p>
<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br>
Romeo.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br>
My nyas?
</p>
<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br>
What o’clock tomorrow<br>
Shall I send to thee?
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br>
By the hour of nine.
</p>
<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br>
I will not fail. ’Tis twenty years till then.<br>
I have forgot why I did call thee back.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br>
Let me stand here till thou remember it.
</p>
<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br>
I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,<br>
Remembering how I love thy company.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br>
And I’ll still stay, to have thee still forget,<br>
Forgetting any other home but this.
</p>
<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br>
’Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone,<br>
And yet no farther than a wanton’s bird,<br>
That lets it hop a little from her hand,<br>
Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,<br>
And with a silk thread plucks it back again,<br>
So loving-jealous of his liberty.
</p>
<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br>
I would I were thy bird.
</p>
<p class="drama">
JULIET.<br>
Sweet, so would I:<br>
Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.<br>
Good night, good night. Parting is such sweet sorrow<br>
That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
</p>
<p class="right">[<i>Exit.</i>]</p>
<p class="drama">
ROMEO.<br>
Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast.<br>
Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest.<br>
Hence will I to my ghostly Sire’s cell,<br>
His help to crave and my dear hap to tell.
