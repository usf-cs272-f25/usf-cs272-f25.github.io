    <h3> <b>SCENE I. A public place.</b></h3>
    <p class="scenedesc">Enter <span class="charname">Sampson</span> and
    <span class="charname">Gregory</span> armed with swords and bucklers.</p>
    <p class="drama">
    SAMPSON.<br>
    Gregory, on my word, we’ll not carry coals.
    </p>
    <p class="drama">
    GREGORY.<br>
    No, for then we should be colliers.
    </p>
    <p class="drama">
    SAMPSON.<br>
    I mean, if we be in choler, we’ll draw.
    </p>
    <p class="drama">
    GREGORY.<br>
    Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o’ the collar.
    </p>
    <p class="drama">
    SAMPSON.<br>
    I strike quickly, being moved.
    </p>
    <p class="drama">
    GREGORY.<br>
    But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
    </p>
    <p class="drama">
    SAMPSON.<br>
    A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
    </p>
    <p class="drama">
    GREGORY.<br>
    To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:
    therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn’st away.
    </p>
    <p class="drama">
    SAMPSON.<br>
    A dog of that house shall move me to stand.<br>
    I will take the wall of any man or maid of Montague’s.
    </p>
    <p class="drama">
    GREGORY.<br>
    That shows thee a weak slave, for the weakest goes to the wall.
    </p>
    <p class="drama">
    SAMPSON.<br>
    True, and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
    are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push Montague’s men
    from the wall, and thrust his maids to the wall.
    </p>
    <p class="drama">
    GREGORY.<br>
    The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
    </p>
    <p class="drama">
    SAMPSON.<br>
    ’Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I have fought
    with the men I will be civil with the maids, I will cut off their heads.
    </p>
    <p class="drama">
    GREGORY.<br>
    The heads of the maids?
    </p>
    <p class="drama">
    SAMPSON.<br>
    Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads; take it in what sense
    thou wilt.
    </p>
    <p class="drama">
    GREGORY.<br>
    They must take it in sense that feel it.
    </p>
    <p class="drama">
    SAMPSON.<br>
    Me they shall feel while I am able to stand:
    and ’tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.
    </p>
    <p class="drama">
    GREGORY.<br>
    ’Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst been poor
    John. Draw thy tool; here comes of the house of Montagues.
    </p>
    <p class="scenedesc">Enter <span class="charname">Abram</span> and
    <span class="charname">Balthasar</span>.</p>
    <p class="drama">
    SAMPSON.<br>
    My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.
    </p>
    <p class="drama">
    GREGORY.<br>
    How? Turn thy back and run?
    </p>
    <p class="drama">
    SAMPSON.<br>
    Fear me not.
    </p>
    <p class="drama">
    GREGORY.<br>
    No, marry; I fear thee!
    </p>
    <p class="drama">
    SAMPSON.<br>
    Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.
    </p>
    <p class="drama">
    GREGORY.<br>
    I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they
    list.</p>
    <p class="drama">
    SAMPSON.<br>
    Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them, which is
    disgrace to them if they bear it.
    </p>
    <p class="drama">
    ABRAM.<br>
    Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
    </p>
    <p class="drama">
    SAMPSON.<br>
    I do bite my thumb, sir.
    </p>
    <p class="drama">
    ABRAM.<br>
    Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
    </p>
    <p class="drama">
    SAMPSON.<br>
    Is the law of our side if I say ay?
    </p>
    <p class="drama">
    GREGORY.<br>
    No.
    </p>
    <p class="drama">
    SAMPSON.<br>
    No sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my
    thumb, sir.</p>
    <p class="drama">
    GREGORY.<br>
    Do you quarrel, sir?
    </p>
    <p class="drama">
    ABRAM.<br>
    Quarrel, sir? No, sir.
    </p>
    <p class="drama">
    SAMPSON.<br>
    But if you do, sir, I am for you. I serve as good a man as
    you.</p>
    <p class="drama">
    ABRAM.<br>
    No better.
    </p>
    <p class="drama">
    SAMPSON.<br>
    Well, sir.
    </p>
    <p class="scenedesc">Enter <span class="charname">Benvolio</span>.</p>
    <p class="drama">
    GREGORY.<br>
    Say better; here comes one of my master’s kinsmen.

    SAMPSON.<br>
    Yes, better, sir.

    That quench the fire of your pernicious rage<br>
    With purple fountains issuing from your veins,<br>
    On pain of torture, from those bloody hands<br>
    Throw your mistemper’d weapons to the ground<br>
    And hear the sentence of your moved prince.<br>
    Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,<br>
    By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,<br>
    Have thrice disturb’d the quiet of our streets,<br>
    And made Verona’s ancient citizens<br>
    Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,<br>

    The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar’d,<br>
    Which, as he breath’d defiance to my ears,<br>
    He swung about his head, and cut the winds,<br>
    Who nothing hurt withal, hiss’d him in scorn.<br>
    While we were interchanging thrusts and blows<br>
    Came more and more, and fought on part and part,<br>

    BENVOLIO.<br>
    Madam, an hour before the worshipp’d sun<br>
    Peer’d forth the golden window of the east,<br>
    A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad,<br>
    Where underneath the grove of sycamore<br>
    That westward rooteth from this city side,<br>
    So early walking did I see your son.<br>
    Towards him I made, but he was ware of me,<br>
    And stole into the covert of the wood.<br>
    I, measuring his affections by my own,<br>
    Which then most sought where most might not be found,<br>
    Being one too many by my weary self,<br>
    Pursu’d my humour, not pursuing his,<br>
    And gladly shunn’d who gladly fled from me.
    </p>
    <p class="drama">
    MONTAGUE.<br>
    Many a morning hath he there been seen,<br>
    With tears augmenting the fresh morning’s dew,<br>
    Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;<br>
    But all so soon as the all-cheering sun<br>
    Should in the farthest east begin to draw<br>
    The shady curtains from Aurora’s bed,<br>
    Away from light steals home my heavy son,<br>
    And private in his chamber pens himself,<br>
    Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out<br>
    And makes himself an artificial night.<br>
    Black and portentous must this humour prove,<br>
    Unless good counsel may the cause remove.

    Both by myself and many other friends;<br>
    But he, his own affections’ counsellor,<br>
    Is to himself—I will not say how true—<br>
    But to himself so secret and so close,<br>
    So far from sounding and discovery,<br>
    As is the bud bit with an envious worm<br>
    Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,<br>
    Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.<br>
    Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,<br>
    We would as willingly give cure as know.

    Why such is love’s transgression.<br>
    Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,<br>
    Which thou wilt propagate to have it prest<br>
    With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown<br>
    Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.<br>
    Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs;<br>
    Being purg’d, a fire sparkling in lovers’ eyes;<br>
    Being vex’d, a sea nourish’d with lovers’ tears:<br>
    What is it else? A madness most discreet,<br>
    A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.<br>
    Farewell, my coz.

    BENVOLIO.<br>
    Soft! I will go along:<br>
    And if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
    </p>
    <p class="drama">
    ROMEO.<br>
    Tut! I have lost myself; I am not here.<br>
    This is not Romeo, he’s some other where.

    <p class="drama">
    BENVOLIO.<br>
    Tell me in sadness who is that you love?
    </p>
    <p class="drama">
    ROMEO.<br>
    What, shall I groan and tell thee?
    </p>
    <p class="drama">
    BENVOLIO.<br>
    Groan! Why, no; but sadly tell me who.
    </p>
    <p class="drama">
    ROMEO.<br>
    Bid a sick man in sadness make his will,<br>
    A word ill urg’d to one that is so ill.<br>
    In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
    </p>
    <p class="drama">
    BENVOLIO.<br>
    I aim’d so near when I suppos’d you lov’d.

    A right good markman, and she’s fair I love.
    </p>
    <p class="drama">
    BENVOLIO.<br>
    A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
    </p>
    <p class="drama">
    ROMEO.<br>
    Well, in that hit you miss: she’ll not be hit<br>
    With Cupid’s arrow, she hath Dian’s wit;<br>
    And in strong proof of chastity well arm’d,<br>
    From love’s weak childish bow she lives uncharm’d.<br>
    She will not stay the siege of loving terms<br>
    Nor bide th’encounter of assailing eyes,<br>
    Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:<br>
    O she’s rich in beauty, only poor<br>
    That when she dies, with beauty dies her store.
    </p>
    <p class="drama">
    BENVOLIO.<br>
    Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
    </p>
    <p class="drama">
    ROMEO.<br>
    She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;<br>
    For beauty starv’d with her severity,<br>
    Cuts beauty off from all posterity.<br>
    She is too fair, too wise; wisely too fair,<br>
    To merit bliss by making me despair.<br>
    She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow<br>
    Do I live dead, that live to tell it now.
    </p>
    <p class="drama">
    BENVOLIO.<br>
    Be rul’d by me, forget to think of her.
    </p>
    <p class="drama">
    ROMEO.<br>
    O teach me how I should forget to think.
    </p>
    <p class="drama">
    BENVOLIO.<br>
    By giving liberty unto thine eyes;<br>
    Examine other beauties.
    </p>
    <p class="drama">
    ROMEO.<br>
    ’Tis the way<br>
    To call hers, exquisite, in question more.<br>
    These happy masks that kiss fair ladies’ brows,<br>
    Being black, puts us in mind they hide the fair;<br>
    He that is strucken blind cannot forget<br>
    The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.<br>
    Show me a mistress that is passing fair,<br>
    What doth her beauty serve but as a note<br>
    Where I may read who pass’d that passing fair?<br>
    Farewell, thou canst not teach me to forget.
    </p>
    <p class="drama">
    BENVOLIO.<br>
    I’ll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.
