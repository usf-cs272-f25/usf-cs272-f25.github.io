# Generic Autograder Setup

---

## Clone onto your machine

```sh
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/phpeterson-usf/autograder
git clone https://github.com/usf-cs272-f25/tests/
```

---

## Add the script to your PATH (recent Macs)

```sh
cd ~
nano .zshrc
```

Add this line

```sh
export PATH=~/Desktop/CS272/autograder:$PATH
```

Save and quit

```sh
source .zshrc
```

---

## Add the script to your PATH (Windows or older Macs)

```sh
cd ~
nano .bashrc
```

Add this line (no spaces aroung the '=')

```sh
export PATH=~/Desktop/CS272/autograder:$PATH
```

Save and quit your editor

```sh
source .bashrc
```

---

## Testing

```sh
cd project01-phpeterson-usf
grade test

---
## Optional - python virtual environment

1. Windows and Linux users can probably install python packages using 
    ```
    cd autograder 
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt --user
    ```
2. If you get permission errors, (common on MacOS) you should use a python virtual environment as shown in the autograder README
---
## Optional - test cases somewhere besides ~

```sh
cd ~/.config/grade
nano config.toml
```

1. Look for `[Tests]`
2. Uncomment `tests_path` by removing the '#'
3. Change the `tests_path` to where you cloned tests, e.g. 

    ```sh
    tests_path = "~/Desktop/CS272/tests"
    ```

4. The Unix shell is case sensitive

# Autograder with Go

---

## Why? We already have `go test`

1. Autograder is instructor/TA automation. It runs over all student repos, calculates late penalty, uploads to Canvas, 
1. I can assign rubric values to each test case

---

## How?

1. Test case script calls `go test`, records result
1. Git pull in the tests repo for every assignment
1. Demo
